\chapter{Phase I : DSE Of Safety Metrics And Resource Constraints}\label{chapter:constraints}

\section{Safety metrics and deployment constraints}

Need to give an example scenario depicting the importance of each type of constraint. Give the formal notations of each.

\subsection{PMHF Constraints}

\subsection{Resource Constraints}

\subsection{Cost Constraints}

\subsection{Memory Constraint}

\subsection{Power Constraint}

\subsection{Node usage Constraint}

\section{Integration into AF3}

Use an exemplary logical architecture and technical architecture and depict the effect of each constraint on deployment generation process of AF3.

Use screenshots.
