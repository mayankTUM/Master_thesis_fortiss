Talk about the thesis contribution

1. Extending the DSE phase of embedded system engineering with safety metrics and resource constraints identified in ISO 26262 to yield safer and reliable deployments

2. Exploring different DSE Optimization approaches (MaxSAT for MOO, Mcses, Branch and bound, etc.) and comparing them with each other to yield an optimal deployment (pareto-optimal).

3. Integrating step 1 and step 2 into AF3 deployment and schedule generation functionality, as well as technical architecture generation functionality. 

4. Evaluating the results using an industrial-like case-study in accordance with the SAFE-E project. 

5. Published the results in SAFE Deliverable 4.4.a, chapter 10.
