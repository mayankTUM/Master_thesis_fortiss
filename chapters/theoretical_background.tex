\section{ISO 26262}

"State of the art" standard followed in automotive domain.  

Different ways to assess hardware architecture for reliability in context of random hardware failures.

Explain terms like safety goal, hardware architectural metrics, PMHF, FRC, etc. 

\section{SAFE - ITEA}

Talk about the safe project in brief

\section{AUTOFOCUS3}

Different layers of abstraction

1. Logical Architecture

2. Platform Architecture

And much more ..

\subsection{Deployment and scheduling in AF3}

Explanation about the deployment and scheduling process prior to inclusion of safety and resource constraints.

\subsection{Technical Architecture Generation}

Show the current work. How can it be improved with adding more criterias?
